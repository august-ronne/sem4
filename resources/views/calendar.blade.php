            <p>On this website Chef August, proud owner of
                Painfully Mediocre Recipes, has collected his
                favorite mediocre recipes for you to enjoy.</p>
            <p>Due to a general lack of ambition there are currently
                only two recipes available for our guests, but more
                are on the way!</p>
            <p>You can find all our recipes by clicking on 'Recipes'
                in the menu, or if you wish to have a special dish recommended
                to you for each day of the month, you should click on
                Calendar.</p>
            <p>Hope you enjoy your visit.</p>
